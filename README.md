Discussion from David J. C. Mackay's  book Information theory, 
Inference, and Learning Algorithms regarding tripos question:

Unstable particles are emitted from a source and decay at
a distance x, a real number that has an exponential
probability distribution with characteristic length $\lambda$.
Decay events can be observed only if they occur in a window extending
from x = 1 cm to x = 20 cm. N decarys are observed at locations 
${x_{1}, ... x_{N}}$. What is $\lambda$?
